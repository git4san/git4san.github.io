# LLM-Powered Cybersecurity Intelligence & Defense Framework (LLM-SHIELD)
---

<div class="research-section">
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, traditional security solutions struggle to keep pace. This project introduces LLM-SHIELD, an AI-driven cybersecurity framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs), DeepSeek, reinforcement learning (RL), and automated security reasoning to create a next-generation defense system.</p>
        <p> LLM-SHIELD focuses on real-time cyber threat detection, adaptive defense mechanisms, and automated vulnerability analysis, ensuring a proactive security posture against both known and zero-day attacks.</p>
