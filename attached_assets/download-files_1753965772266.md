## Files You Need to Download

To deploy your website to GitHub Pages, you need to download these files from your Replit project:

### Main Files:
1. `index.html` - Homepage
2. `projects.html` - Projects page
3. `publications.html` - Publications page
4. `cv.html` - CV page
5. `contact.html` - Contact page
6. `styles.css` - All styling
7. `script.js` - JavaScript functionality

### How to Download:
1. In Replit, click on each file in the file explorer
2. Use Ctrl+A (or Cmd+A on Mac) to select all content
3. Copy the content and paste it into a new file on your computer
4. Save each file with the exact same name

### Alternative Method:
1. Click the three dots (...) next to any file in Replit
2. Select "Download" to download individual files
3. Or use the "Download as zip" option if available

## Upload to GitHub:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all these files to the repository
3. Go to repository Settings > Pages
4. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click Save

Your site will be available at:

## Important Notes:
- Make sure all file names are exactly as shown above
- Keep the file structure flat (all files in the root directory)
- GitHub Pages may take a few minutes to update after uploading
