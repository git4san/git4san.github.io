        <p>This project aimed to secure Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in their communication protocols and control applications. SCADA systems are critical for industrial automation and infrastructure, making them prime targets for cyber attacks. The primary focus was to enhance the security posture of these systems through fuzzing techniques combined with other analysis methods. The key activities involved:</p>

  <ul class="project-steps justified-text">
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Protocol Analysis and Reverse Engineering:</strong>
            <p>Conducted reverse engineering of SCADA protocols to understand their structure, behavior, and potential vulnerabilities. Developed custom parsers for undocumented or proprietary protocols used in industrial control systems to facilitate fuzzing and vulnerability detection.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #28A745;">Fuzzing Implementation for SCADA Protocols:</strong>
            <p>Implemented fuzzing frameworks tailored for SCADA systems, focusing on field device communication and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) interactions. Applied generation-based fuzzing to craft input sequences that mimic realistic yet potentially malicious communications, maximizing the potential for uncovering security flaws.</p>
            <ul class="sub-steps">
                <li>Used mutation-based fuzzing to generate a wide range of malformed and boundary case inputs, targeting the resilience and robustness of SCADA components.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #FFC107;">Vulnerability Detection and Mitigation:</strong>
            <p>Analyzed the results of fuzzing tests to detect anomalies, such as unexpected crashes, memory corruption, and protocol deviations, indicating potential vulnerabilities. Conducted root cause analysis for identified vulnerabilities and collaborated with development teams to design patches or mitigation techniques, enhancing the overall security of SCADA systems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #DC3545;">Information Flow and Data Integrity Monitoring:</strong>
            <p>Applied information flow tracking within SCADA environments to ensure data integrity and trace unauthorized modifications or leakages during fuzzing tests. Integrated these insights with fuzzing outcomes to gain a comprehensive understanding of how vulnerabilities could impact system operations and lead to data breaches.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
