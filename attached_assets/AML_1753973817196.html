    <h2>1. <span class="important">Introduction to Adversarial Machine Learning</span></h2>
    <p>Adversarial machine learning (Adversarial ML) is a subfield of machine learning focused on understanding and mitigating the vulnerabilities of machine learning (ML) models to adversarial attacks. These attacks involve deliberately manipulating input data to mislead the model, resulting in incorrect predictions or classifications. The rise of AI and ML in critical applications such as autonomous driving, facial recognition, cybersecurity, and healthcare has made these models a target for adversarial attacks, presenting a serious challenge for their deployment in real-world scenarios.</p>
    <p>Adversarial ML exploits the inherent weaknesses in ML algorithms, where small, often imperceptible changes to input data can cause significant performance degradation. This report delves into the latest trends, techniques, and advancements in adversarial machine learning, highlighting both the challenges and solutions to defend against adversarial attacks.</p>
    
    <h2>2. <span class="important">The Fundamentals of Adversarial Attacks</span></h2>
    <div class="trend-box">
        <h4>Types of Adversarial Attacks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>White-box Attacks:</strong> Attacker has full access to model architecture, parameters, and training data.</li>
            <li><strong>Black-box Attacks:</strong> Attacker does not have access to model internals, only outputs from queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted vs. Untargeted Attacks:</strong> Targeted attacks aim for specific misclassification; untargeted aim to confuse the model in any way.</li>
            <li><strong>Poisoning Attacks:</strong> Manipulating training data to make the model behave maliciously.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>3. <span class="important">Adversarial Machine Learning: Current Trends</span></h2>
    <div class="trend-box">
        <h4>3.1 Adversarial Attacks in Deep Learning</h4>
        <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their complexity and high-dimensional nature. Adversarial perturbations in deep learning models can cause catastrophic failures in applications ranging from image classification to natural language processing (NLP).</p>
