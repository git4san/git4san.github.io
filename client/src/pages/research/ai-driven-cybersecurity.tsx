            The integration of AI into cybersecurity is not a sudden phenomenon but rather an evolution of technologies aimed at improving the effectiveness of threat detection, incident response, and proactive defense. Traditionally, cybersecurity relied on signature-based detection and rule-based systems. However, with the rise of complex attacks, including zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats (APTs), these methods became increasingly ineffective.

            AI technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) have enhanced cybersecurity by enabling real-time threat analysis, predictive capabilities, and adaptive learning. AI-driven solutions provide the ability to identify patterns, anomalies, and behaviors indicative of cyber-attacksâ€”often before they can manifest in full force.
