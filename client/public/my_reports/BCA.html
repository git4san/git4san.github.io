  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Blockchain technology has revolutionized the digital landscape by providing a decentralized, secure, and transparent way of recording transactions. Originally designed to support Bitcoin, blockchain has expanded far beyond cryptocurrencies into sectors such as finance, supply chain, healthcare, and more. Its fundamental structure as a distributed ledger ensures trust and removes the need for intermediaries.

<section id="trends">
  <h2>Latest Trends in Blockchain Technology</h2>
  <div class="accordion-container">
    <button class="collapsible">1. Blockchain for Sustainable Development</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Blockchain is being increasingly adopted to enhance sustainability efforts, such as tracking carbon credits and ensuring ethical sourcing in supply chains. Its immutable nature ensures that data related to environmental and social impact remains transparent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">2. Interoperability Among Blockchain Networks</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The push for blockchain interoperability aims to allow seamless interaction between different blockchain networks. Technologies like Polkadot and Cosmos are at the forefront, enabling cross-chain transactions and data sharing to break down silos and improve scalability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        DeFi has emerged as a major trend, providing financial services without the need for traditional banking systems. Smart contracts facilitate everything from lending and borrowing to trading and insurance, creating an open financial system accessible to anyone with internet access.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">4. Adoption of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        NFTs have gained mainstream attention, representing ownership of unique digital assets such as art, music, and virtual real estate. This trend has opened new avenues for artists and creators, reshaping industries like gaming and entertainment.

<section id="applications">
  <h2>Applications of Blockchain Technology</h2>
  <p>
    Blockchain's versatility is evident through its application in various industries. Here are some key examples:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Secure, transparent, and low-cost cross-border payments, smart contracts for automated financial agreements, and digital identities for secure banking access.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Secure patient data management and sharing, ensuring data integrity, and enhancing drug traceability.</li>
    <li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> Real-time tracking of goods, transparency in the origin of products, and mitigation of counterfeiting.</li>
    <li><strong>Voting Systems:</strong> Secure, tamper-proof digital voting platforms that enhance trust and participation in democratic processes.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="challenges">
  <h2>Challenges Facing Blockchain</h2>
  <div class="accordion-container">
    <button class="collapsible">1. Scalability</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Blockchain networks often face scalability issues due to the need to validate and replicate transactions across nodes. Solutions such as sharding and Layer 2 scaling are being explored to improve throughput.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">2. Energy Consumption</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains consume vast amounts of energy, raising concerns about their environmental impact. New consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake (PoS) are helping to reduce this footprint.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">3. Regulatory Uncertainty</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Governments around the world are still working to define regulations for blockchain applications. This uncertainty can hinder innovation and adoption as businesses navigate a complex legal landscape.
      </p>
    </div>
